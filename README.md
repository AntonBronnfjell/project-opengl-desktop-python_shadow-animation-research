# Project BA3: Shadows in Games and Animations
=======

## Assignment

One of the features that makes animations and video games more realistic is lighting — and specifically the shadows that appear when objects block light. Various algorithms have been proposed to improve the quality of these shadows (hard or soft) or to allow them to update easily when the light orientation changes. In this project you will examine the field of shadow rendering algorithms and compare a few of them in a 3D simulation environment such as OpenGL. The goal is to test their positive and negative aspects and see the conditions under which they produce the best results. You may also create your own applications.
